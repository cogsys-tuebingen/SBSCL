# The Systems Biology Simulation Core Library

#### Description
The Systems Biology Simulation Core Library (SBSCL) provides an efficient and exhaustive Java implementation of methods to interpret the content of models encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and its numerical solution. This library is based on the JSBML project and can be used on every operating system for which a Java Virtual Machine is available. Please note that this project does not contain any user interface, neither a command-line interface, nor a graphical user interface. This project has been developed as a pure programming library. To support the MIASE effort, it understands SED-ML files. Its abstract type and interface hierarchy facilitates the implementation of further community standards, such as CellML.
