     SBMLsimulator core NEWS -- History of user-visible changes
======================================================================
Version 1.2 (2012-xx-xx)
======================================================================

 * New features:
   
   - A new pom.xml file has been added to the project in order to
     support Maven for this library.
 
 * Bug fixes: 

======================================================================
Version 1.1 (2012-05-04)
======================================================================

 * New features:
 
   - Support for SED-ML (Simulation Experiment Description
     Markup Language, Waltemath et al., 2011) to facilitate the re-use
     and reproduction of simulation experiments by reading and 
     executing SED-ML files. See the new package org.simulator.sedml
     and the new test cases in the test folder.
   
   - There is now a convenient ant file build.xml that provides several
     options, such as inclusion of SED-ML support or the automatic
     creation of UML graphs.
     
   - The documentation in JavaDoc has been extensively improved.
 
 * Changes in this version:
 
   - Renamed org.simulator.math.odes.EventInProcess to 
     org.simulator.math.odes.EventInProgress
     
   - Renamed org.simulator.sbml.SBMLEventInProcessWithDelay to
     org.simulator.sbml.SBMLEventInProgressWithDelay
     
   - The separation between the interfaces for arbitrary differential
     equation systems and SBML-specific implementation has become
     very strict. The previous release contained some dependency in
     the event handling to SBML. This has now been resolved by
     introducing a modified type hierarchy of Event object handling.
     
   - The treatment of intermediate results during the evaluation of
     ASTNodes had to be changed due to changes in the JSBML library. 
 
 * Bug fixes:

   - There was a redundant representation of interpreters for SBML-
     specific ASTNode data types. Now there is only one class for this
     purpose that works more efficient than the previous ones.
     
   - An error in the evaluation of AlgebraicRules was corrected. In
     some cases the variable was not correctly identified.
     
   - In some cases the species concentrations were now updated
     correctly after changes of the size of their surrounding 
     compartments. This issue has been fixed now.

======================================================================
Version 1.0 (2012-03-01)
======================================================================

 * New features:
 
 	- MathML expressions with delayed variables are now supported.
 	- Solvers can be canceled while computing.

 * Changes in this version:

  	- Default values are now used for parameters, species and 
  	  compartments, if no values are set.
	- The event processing of the Rosenbrock solver is more
	  efficient.
	- The processing of kinetic laws and rules is faster.

 * Bug fixes in this version:

 	- Steady state computations are not in conflict with events any 
 	  more.
 	- Events with delays are processed correctly.

Version 0.9 (2011-09-28)
======================================================================
