# Getting started #
===================

The folder doc/api contains a directory called version_XX, where XX stands for
the current version of the library. For an introduction of how to use this
library, please open the index.html file from this folder in your system's
web browser. There you can find instructions and source code examples, including
some use cases. The dist folder contains three different versions of JAR files
to work with.


===================
# File structure  #
===================

Just a brief explanation of the folders and files contained in this distribution.

Most importantly, see 
 * the dist folder containing the JAR files
 * the doc folder containing an exhaustive source code and api documentation

The package structure in more detail:
 /
 |- dist        -> Contains three different JAR file versions of the library
 |- doc
    |- api      -> JavaDoc including examples for usage of the library
