<h3>About Simulation Core Library</h3>
The Java API Simulation Core Library comprises a collection of integrators for differential
equation systems combined with an interpreter for the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). 
It is the first simulation library that is based on JSBML.
The user can read an SBML model and simulate it with one of the provided integrators.
All SBML levels and versions are supported.
The library can easily be integrated into other software, such as parameter estimation tools.
</p>

<p>
<h3>The provided integration models</h3>
The Rosenbrock solver is best suitable for integrating stiff differential equation systems
and also has a precise timing of SBML events. It is taken and adapted from Kotcon et al. 
Several solvers have been taken from the Apache Commons Library and wrapped into our library:
<ul>
<li>Adams Bashforth</li>
<li>Adams Moulton</li>
<li>Dormand Prince 54</li>
<li>Dormand Prince 853</li>
<li>Gragg Bulirsch Stoer</li>
<li>Higham Hall 54</li>
</ul>

The following solvers have been implemented additionally and are fast, but not suitable for
all differential equation systems:
<ul>
<li>Euler</li>
<li>Runge Kutta</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Reading in a model and creating the respective differential equation system</h3>
A model can be read in by using the SBMLReader class of JSBML. With the model in memory the
SBMLinterpreter can create the differential equation system that provides the basis for simulation.
</p>
<p><i>Model model = (new SBMLReader()).readSBML(sbmlfile).getModel();</br>

SBMLinterpreter interpreter = new SBMLinterpreter(model);
</i></p>

<p>
<h3>Simulation of a differential equation system</h3>
The created differential equation system can then be simulated with a chosen solver and given time points.
The result is stored in a data structure called MultiTable.
</p>
<p><i>
AbstractDESSolver solver = new RosenbrockSolver();</br>

double[] timePoints = {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5};</br>
		
MultiTable solution = solver.solve(interpreter, interpreter.getInitialValues(), timePoints);
</i></p>

<p>
<h3>How to integrate Simulation Core Library into your software</h3>
You just have to add the provided jar-file simulation-core-library.jar to your Java project. Then you have access to all classes of the library.
