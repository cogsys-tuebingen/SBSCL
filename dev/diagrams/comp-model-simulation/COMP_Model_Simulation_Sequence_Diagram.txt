frame COMP Model Simulation

User->CompSimulator: Passes the sbml file to get  \nthe model from the file and \ninterpret it for the simulation.

note over CompSimulator: - Gets the SBMLDocument from the file\n  using SBMLReader and adds meta-info\n  about original ids

create CompFlatteningConverter(from JSBML)

CompSimulator->CompFlatteningConverter(from JSBML): Asks to flatten the SBMLDocument \n            extracted from the file

note over CompFlatteningConverter(from JSBML): Flattens the SBML Document

CompFlatteningConverter(from JSBML)->CompSimulator: Returns the flattened SBMLDocument

destroyafter CompFlatteningConverter(from JSBML)

CompSimulator->User: Provides its instance necessary\n            for simulation

User->CompSimulator:   Calls the solve() method for \nsimulating the flattened model 

note over CompSimulator: - Solves the flattened model as a simple SBML\n  model (Refer to the SBML model sequence diagram)\n- The output ids are then mapped back to the ids of the\n  original model (using the information stored\n  using AddMetaInfo class)

CompSimulator->User: Returns the solution of the simulation in\n         the form of MultiTable

note over User:          Results can be printed in \ntabular form or plotted in graphical form.
