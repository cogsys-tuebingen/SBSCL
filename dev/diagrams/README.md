## Sequence diagrams describing the workflow of supported simulations

Any updates in the workflow of SBSCL can be updated in the sequence diagrams easily following the procedure given below:
- In every folder of the specific simulation, you will find a `.txt` file which contains the content of the diagram.
- Open the [https://sequencediagram.org/](https://sequencediagram.org/) and copy paste the content from the txt file there.
- You will see the sequence diagram built on the right side and now you can update it according to the updated changes and just export the diagram as an `image` file and update it here in the directory (also update the txt file).
